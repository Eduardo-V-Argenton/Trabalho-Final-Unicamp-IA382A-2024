\section{Introduction}

The seminars cover a range of current and relevant topics in electrical and computing engineering, many of which may be 
unfamiliar to some students. As a result, these students often rely on the seminars to gain a deeper understanding of the 
subjects presented. However, given the lack of time and opportunity of some students, it is important to
consider whether alternative resources, such as popular AI chatbots—specifically ChatGPT, Gemini, and Meta AI—can be trusted
to provide accurate and comprehensive information about these topics. This work aims to assess the reliability
of these AI-driven platforms as sources of knowledge, testing their ability to provide reliable answers about the topics.
By evaluating the accuracy and depth of the information provided by these AIs, the study seeks to determine whether they
can serve as viable substitutes or supplements to traditional seminar-based learning for students in this field.
