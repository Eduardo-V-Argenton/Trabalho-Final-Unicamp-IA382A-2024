\subsection{Generalist vs Specialist Language Models}
\subsubsection{Question}
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    1- What are the main differences between general-purpose LLMs and specialized LLMs?\\
2- How does the concept of "approximate retrieval" help explain the workings of the transformer architecture?\\

\end{tcolorbox}
\subsubsection{ChatGPT}
\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
    1. General-purpose LLMs are versatile but less efficient for specific tasks. Specialized LLMs are optimized for narrower tasks, improving performance in their domain.\\
2. Transformers use attention mechanisms to approximate retrieval, focusing on relevant parts of input instead of processing all information equally.\\
3. Nogueira argues specialization uses fewer resources, improves performance, and reduces training costs compared to scaling general-purpose models.\\
4. Specialization limits generalization. Nogueira suggests modular designs to combine specialized models for broader applications.\\
5. Nogueira predicts a modular ecosystem of smaller, specialized LLMs collaborating for efficiency and versatility.
