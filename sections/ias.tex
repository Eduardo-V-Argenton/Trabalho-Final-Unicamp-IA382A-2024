\section*{AI Tools Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NotebookLM}: An AI tool that exclusively relies on user-inserted sources for generating insights and recommendations. This ensures that its outputs are limited to the content provided by the user, making it ideal for focused and controlled analysis of specific data or topics.

    \item \textbf{Gemini}: A family of AI models developed by Google, designed for a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, image recognition, and complex reasoning. Unlike NotebookLM, Gemini processes information based on a vast training dataset and can provide responses on a variety of general and specific topics.

    \item \textbf{ChatGPT}: An advanced conversational AI developed by OpenAI, built on the GPT architecture. It generates human-like text and provides information based on a large-scale dataset used during training. It is versatile and widely used for applications such as education, content generation, and problem-solving.

    \item \textbf{Meta AI}: A suite of AI technologies developed by Meta (formerly Facebook), covering areas like natural language processing and computer vision. Similar to Gemini and ChatGPT, Meta AI provides information based on extensive training data and powers features across Meta's platforms while also advancing AI research.
