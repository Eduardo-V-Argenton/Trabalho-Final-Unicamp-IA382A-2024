Let's examine your answers in relation to the provided seminar
transcript.

\subsubsection{Examining and Correcting Your
Answers}\label{examining-and-correcting-your-answers}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Answer 1: Holographic communications, tactile internet,
  digital twins, immersive AR/VR, and autonomous systems.}

  The seminar does mention \textbf{immersive AR/VR} and
  \textbf{autonomous systems} as key use cases driving the development
  of 6G. Dohler specifically points to examples like AR glasses and
  autonomous drones as future applications. While not explicitly named,
  \textbf{tactile internet} could fall under the broader category of XR
  devices discussed as a key 6G use case. However, the seminar doesn't
  mention \textbf{holographic communications} or \textbf{digital twins}
  in the context of 6G.
\item
  \textbf{Answer 2: Higher bandwidth, ultra-low latency, massive device
  connectivity, and support for AI-driven services.}

  This is partially correct. The seminar focuses on \textbf{higher
  bandwidth} as a key requirement for 6G, driven by the demands of
  applications like XR and AI agents. While the sources don't explicitly
  mention \textbf{ultra-low latency} or \textbf{massive device
  connectivity} as primary 6G characteristics, they could be implied.
  The seminar strongly emphasizes \textbf{support for AI-driven
  services} as a defining aspect of 6G, with discussions on AI-native
  networks and the integration of AI into various network functions.
\item
  \textbf{Answer 3: Scarcity of available spectrum and interference.
  Solutions include THz band utilization, spectrum sharing, and AI-based
  resource management.}

  This is largely accurate. The seminar highlights the \textbf{scarcity
  of available spectrum}, particularly in the mid-band range, as a
  significant challenge for 6G. The sources mention \textbf{THz band
  utilization} as a potential solution, though Dohler believes
  widespread deployment is unlikely before 2030. \textbf{Spectrum
  sharing}, particularly with government services, is presented as a
  critical strategy for addressing spectrum scarcity. The seminar also
  touches upon \textbf{AI-based resource management} as a means to
  optimize spectrum utilization.
\item
  \textbf{Answer 4: AI is integrated at the core to optimize operations,
  enable self-configuration, and enhance service delivery.}

  This is a precise summary of the seminar's discussion on AI's role in
  6G. The concept of \textbf{AI-native networks} is introduced,
  suggesting that AI will be fundamentally integrated into network
  operations. The seminar emphasizes the use of AI to \textbf{optimize
  network operations}, \textbf{enable self-configuration}, and
  ultimately \textbf{enhance service delivery}.
\item
  \textbf{Answer 5: Increases data traffic due to high computational
  requirements. Semantic communication reduces redundancy by
  transmitting only meaningful information.}

  This is correct. The seminar acknowledges the expected
  \textbf{increase in data traffic} due to the computationally demanding
  nature of 6G applications like AI agents and XR. The concept of
  \textbf{semantic communication} is presented as a key technology for
  mitigating this traffic growth by compressing video and audio data,
  effectively reducing redundancy by focusing on transmitting only
  essential information. Dohler provides a detailed explanation of how
  semantic communication achieves this through latent representation of
  data.
