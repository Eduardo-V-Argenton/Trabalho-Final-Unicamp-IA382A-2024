1. Limitations of Traditional Mathematical Programming Techniques
Traditional techniques struggle with multiple conflicting objectives, non-convex search spaces, and parameter tuning.
2. How Evolutionary Algorithms Address Limitations
Evolutionary algorithms use a population-based approach, handle multiple objectives, and are less sensitive to parameter tuning.
3. Main Families of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms
Non-dominated Sorting-based Algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II)
Indicator-based Algorithms (e.g., SMS-EMOA)
Decomposition-based Algorithms (e.g., MOEA/D)
4. Computational Challenges of Indicator-Based Algorithms
High computational complexity, difficulty scaling to high-dimensional spaces, and requiring additional parameters.
5. Promising Areas of Research
Scalability
Many-Objective Optimization
Hybridization
Real-World Applications
