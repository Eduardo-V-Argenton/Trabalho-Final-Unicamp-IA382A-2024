1. AGI refers to AI with human-level intelligence, capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across various tasks. ANI, on the other hand, is designed for specific tasks, lacking the breadth and depth of AGI.
2. Current hardware limitations include energy consumption, processing speed, and memory capacity, especially for complex tasks and massive datasets.
3. Neuromorphic chips and memristors, inspired by biological brains, offer potential solutions by mimicking neural networks, reducing energy consumption, and increasing processing speed.
4. Ethical concerns include potential job displacement, autonomous decision-making, and the risk of misuse. Ensuring transparency, accountability, and human oversight is crucial.
5. Startups offer agility and innovation, focusing on niche areas and emerging technologies. Established companies have resources and expertise but may be slower to adapt. Both have valuable roles in AGI development.
