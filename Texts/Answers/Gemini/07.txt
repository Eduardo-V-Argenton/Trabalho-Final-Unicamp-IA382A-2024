1- PINNs are data-efficient and physics-informed but computationally expensive.
2- The team transitioned to ROMs for computational efficiency.
3- ROMs accelerate simulations but can be less accurate.
4- Operator inference stands out by learning underlying physical laws.
5- Quantum computing can accelerate scientific machine learning, including greenhouse gas emission estimation.
