1- Holographic communications, tactile internet, digital twins, immersive AR/VR, and autonomous systems.
2- Higher bandwidth, ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and support for AI-driven services.
3- Scarcity of available spectrum and interference. Solutions include THz band utilization, spectrum sharing, and AI-based resource management.
4- AI is integrated at the core to optimize operations, enable self-configuration, and enhance service delivery.
5- Increases data traffic due to high computational requirements. Semantic communication reduces redundancy by transmitting only meaningful information.
