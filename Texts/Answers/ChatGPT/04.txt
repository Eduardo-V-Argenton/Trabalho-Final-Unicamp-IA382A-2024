1- Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC).
2- Fully programmable, dynamically adjustable surfaces integrated into network control.
3- Signal enhancement, interference cancellation, and coverage extension.
4- By controlling reflection properties, RIS can mitigate eavesdropping and enable secure beamforming.
5- Secure quantum-resistant communication and covert data transmission.
