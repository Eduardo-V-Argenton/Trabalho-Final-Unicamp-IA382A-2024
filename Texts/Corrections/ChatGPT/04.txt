Here are the corrected answers, along with insights from the sources to enhance your understanding:

1.  **Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC).**

    This is **correct**. The seminar states that these three service categories form the points of 5G's "famous triangle." By 6G, the vision expands to a hexagon, incorporating additional pillars such as AI integration and integrated sensing and communication.
2.  **Fully passive surfaces with reconfigurable elements controlled by a software-defined radio.**

    The initial answer is partially correct, but the sources highlight the diverse nature of RIS architectures.  Currently, the seminar emphasizes **passive surfaces** with **reconfigurable elements** that are **controlled by software-defined radio**. This means that these surfaces reflect signals without amplifying them and can be adjusted to manipulate signal propagation. However, the speaker envisions future architectures with **active elements** capable of **amplification**, and even the possibility of **hybrid RIS** combining passive and active elements. This evolution suggests a trajectory towards more sophisticated and capable RIS in the future.
3.  **Signal enhancement and coverage extension, particularly in shadowed areas, using signal reflections.**

    This is more accurate. The sources primarily focus on RIS's ability to **enhance signals** and **extend coverage**, especially in **shadowed areas** where signals struggle to penetrate. This is achieved through **strategically reflecting signals** to bypass obstacles and reach users more effectively. While **interference cancellation** is mentioned as a potential application, it is not the main focus of the seminar. The seminar demonstrates, through experiments, that RIS can significantly improve signal strength, with results showing increases of up to 10 dB in specific setups.
4.  **RIS can be exploited by hackers to degrade signal quality or increase jamming, but it can also be used to enhance security by optimizing signal reflections to favor legitimate users and hinder eavesdroppers.**

    This accurately reflects the seminar's discussion on the security implications of RIS. While it can be a valuable tool for **enhancing security**, RIS is also vulnerable to **malicious exploitation**. Hackers could manipulate RIS to **degrade signal quality**, amplify **jamming attacks**, or even **eavesdrop** on communications. However, the seminar also explores how RIS can be used to **improve security** by **optimizing signal reflections** to favor legitimate users and create blind spots for eavesdroppers. This highlights the importance of secure RIS control and management to prevent its use for malicious purposes.
5.  **Secure key generation for short-range, low-rate applications, potentially mitigating the future threat of quantum computers to current cryptographic techniques, particularly in IoT and other resource-constrained devices.**

    This is a more precise description. The seminar positions **noise-driven communication** as a potential method for **secure key generation**, but it emphasizes its suitability for **short-range, low-rate applications** like those commonly found in IoT. It is presented as a way to address the looming threat of **quantum computers**, which could potentially break the cryptographic techniques widely used today. However, the seminar does not explicitly classify it as "quantum-resistant communication," focusing instead on its practicality for resource-constrained devices where implementing robust cryptographic measures might be challenging. The speaker suggests that noise-based systems could be used for key generation within data centers or even between components within a computer, highlighting the potential for localized, secure communication.
