Let's examine your answers in relation to the provided seminar transcript.

### Examining and Correcting Your Answers

*   **Answer 1: Holographic communications, tactile internet, digital twins, immersive AR/VR, and autonomous systems.**

    The seminar does mention **immersive AR/VR** and **autonomous systems** as key use cases driving the development of 6G. Dohler specifically points to examples like AR glasses and autonomous drones as future applications. While not explicitly named, **tactile internet** could fall under the broader category of XR devices discussed as a key 6G use case. However, the seminar doesn't mention **holographic communications** or **digital twins** in the context of 6G.
*   **Answer 2: Higher bandwidth, ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and support for AI-driven services.**

    This is partially correct. The seminar focuses on **higher bandwidth** as a key requirement for 6G, driven by the demands of applications like XR and AI agents. While the sources don't explicitly mention **ultra-low latency** or **massive device connectivity** as primary 6G characteristics, they could be implied. The seminar strongly emphasizes **support for AI-driven services** as a defining aspect of 6G, with discussions on AI-native networks and the integration of AI into various network functions.
*   **Answer 3: Scarcity of available spectrum and interference. Solutions include THz band utilization, spectrum sharing, and AI-based resource management.**

    This is largely accurate. The seminar highlights the **scarcity of available spectrum**, particularly in the mid-band range, as a significant challenge for 6G. The sources mention **THz band utilization** as a potential solution, though Dohler believes widespread deployment is unlikely before 2030. **Spectrum sharing**, particularly with government services, is presented as a critical strategy for addressing spectrum scarcity.  The seminar also touches upon **AI-based resource management** as a means to optimize spectrum utilization.
*   **Answer 4: AI is integrated at the core to optimize operations, enable self-configuration, and enhance service delivery.**

    This is a precise summary of the seminar's discussion on AI's role in 6G. The concept of **AI-native networks** is introduced, suggesting that AI will be fundamentally integrated into network operations. The seminar emphasizes the use of AI to **optimize network operations**, **enable self-configuration**, and ultimately **enhance service delivery**.
*   **Answer 5: Increases data traffic due to high computational requirements. Semantic communication reduces redundancy by transmitting only meaningful information.**

    This is correct. The seminar acknowledges the expected **increase in data traffic** due to the computationally demanding nature of 6G applications like AI agents and XR. The concept of **semantic communication** is presented as a key technology for mitigating this traffic growth by compressing video and audio data, effectively reducing redundancy by focusing on transmitting only essential information. Dohler provides a detailed explanation of how semantic communication achieves this through latent representation of data.
