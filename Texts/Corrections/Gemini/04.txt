Here are the corrected answers, along with insights from the sources to enhance your understanding:

1.  **Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC).**

    This is **correct**. The seminar mentions that these three service categories make up the points of 5G's "famous triangle," representing the key focus areas of 5G technology. Looking ahead to 6G, the vision expands to a hexagon, with additional pillars like AI integration and integrated sensing and communication added to the original three. This expansion reflects the changing landscape of wireless communication needs as we move toward 6G and beyond.
2.  **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)**

    The provided answer is close, but needs a slight adjustment. The correct terminology used in the sources is **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)**, not IRIS. This term more accurately reflects the nature of these surfaces â€“ they are designed to be reconfigurable, allowing for dynamic adjustments to their properties to control and optimize signal propagation.
3.  **Enhancing wireless coverage and providing secure communication through signal manipulation.**

    This is a more accurate representation based on the information provided in the sources. The seminar heavily emphasizes the ability of RIS to **enhance wireless coverage**, particularly in areas with weak signal strength or where obstacles impede signal propagation. This is achieved by strategically **reflecting signals** off the RIS to bypass obstacles and reach users more effectively.

    The sources also discuss the potential of RIS to **improve security in wireless communication**. By controlling the reflection properties of RIS, it is possible to **favor legitimate users and hinder eavesdroppers**, making it more difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept sensitive information.

    While **improving energy efficiency** is a significant consideration in wireless communication systems, the seminar does not explicitly highlight this as a primary benefit of using RIS. Therefore, it's best to focus on the aspects that are directly discussed in the sources.
4.  **By strategically reflecting and focusing signals, RIS can enhance coverage, mitigate interference, and improve security in wireless communication systems.**

    This statement provides a more precise explanation of how RIS functions to achieve the benefits discussed in the sources. RIS, as the seminar explains, works by **strategically reflecting and focusing signals**. This capability is the foundation for its various applications:

    *   **Enhancing Coverage:** By reflecting signals around obstacles and directing them towards users in shadowed areas, RIS can significantly improve coverage.
    *   **Mitigating Interference:** RIS can also be used to reflect signals away from areas where they might cause interference, thereby improving overall signal quality.
    *   **Improving Security:** By strategically focusing signals toward legitimate users and creating blind spots for potential eavesdroppers, RIS can contribute to enhancing the security of wireless communication.

    The seminar focuses on the practical applications of RIS, emphasizing the role of signal manipulation in achieving desired outcomes.
5.  **Noise-driven communication could be used for secure communication in short-range, low-rate applications and as a potential solution to the threat of quantum computers, especially for resource-constrained devices like those in IoT.**

    This statement accurately reflects the seminar's discussion of noise-driven communication and its potential applications.  The seminar highlights its suitability for **secure communication in short-range, low-rate applications**, which are commonly found in the Internet of Things (IoT).

    The seminar also emphasizes the looming threat of **quantum computers**, which could potentially break the widely used cryptographic techniques that protect our digital world today. Noise-driven communication is presented as a possible solution to this challenge, especially for **resource-constrained devices** where implementing complex cryptographic measures might be challenging.

    While the seminar discusses the use of noise for secure key generation, it does not explicitly claim that noise-driven communication offers "quantum communication" capabilities. It is essential to stay within the boundaries of what the sources explicitly state.
